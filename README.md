# VHDLProcessor
As a part of Computer Architecture assignement I created a processor in Verilog Hardware Description Language which had the micro operational capabilities such as adding, subtracting, incrementing, multiplying two values stored in registers and Conditional Branching. The processor design had a 16 bit register file of 9 registers.
